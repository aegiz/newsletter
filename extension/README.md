# Chrome extension

This Chrome extension once installed in your browser will allow you to:

1. Take a screenshot of the page.
2. Fill out more info (like title, description)
3. All these info are pushed and stored to a dedicated Airtable sheet.

Note that with retina display you will have first to zoom to 50% in the extension screen to make it fits the screen.
