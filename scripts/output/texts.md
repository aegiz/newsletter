Hi everybody, how is everything going?

On my side, things have been running smoothly: we are now a couple of weeks away from the baby delivery (yes I am going to be a first-time dad!) and we are finalizing the last little details
Otherwise, regarding this newsletter: this week I shot a full walkthrough of how I create it. So, in case you are interested in seeing a bit more details about how everything has been automated this one is for you!

I wish you a wonderful weekend!

When I saw this video it immediately reminded me of these superb hidden streetart blocks and the LEGO tiny house some people created on Twitter.
I found the intersection between the two simply magical ✨
