Hello friends!<br><br>
How is this long easter weekend going?<br><br>
Not so many easter eggs for me this year, but instead a nice batch of French rillettes freshly arrived from France 😋.
AND because I love sharing my findings I listed the recipe at the end of this edition.<br><br>Bonne dégustation!

When I took this picture in December 2018 I remember distinctly wondering what all these Korean blue flags were.<br>At that time, my partner and I were visiting the DMZ and we eventually found out that <a class='email-link' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Unification_Flag' target='_blank'>the Korean unification flag</a> is a symbol of peaceful relationship and coexistence.<br><br>So, it was a nice surprise to meet again with this blue flag.<br>I crossed my fingers and hope that in 2032 there will be more of this!
