Congrats! 📩

Hello friends!

I hope you had a great week! Mine was full of highs and lows, but on the bright side we got our doggo back to our place!

Regarding this week edition, there is quite a lot of long read articles in there. So, pro-tip if it's taking you too long and you feel rather bored or hungry: jump directly to the end of this newsletter for a tasty surprise.

Flex!

"Oh no, not again a nerdy video for the Highlight of the week!" I already hear you say.
Well yes, I won't lie it's about Mathematics. But, but, but bear with me, it also involves 🍕 and a story of Newton making great discoveries while being in lockdown. So, in the end, it's actually a very nice video ;-)
