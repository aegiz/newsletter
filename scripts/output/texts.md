Let's be honest, it's a complicated period of time and everybody is exhausted.
So I won't start with my usual question "how's everything going" but will rather ask you: "I hope you are doing okay"?

On the menu this week quite a lot of animals videos actually: Cats, dogs, ducks and an actually super cute spider video.

Courage!

Earlier this week while browsing my Twitter history I stumbled upon <a class='email-link' href='#' target='_blank'>this video</a> from the artist and performer Farewell.
If I remember distinctly sharing this video back in 2014 I actually never took the time to see the others ones!
So give yourself a favor and watch these creative gems :-)
