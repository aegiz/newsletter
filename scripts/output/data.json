    "content": "Dear friends and subscribers, I wanted to start this newsletter with two words:<br>‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù.<br>It‚Äôs indeed thanks to you and your referrals that we are now about to reach 100 subscribers. For the occasion, I rebranded the official <a class='email-link' href='https://www.instagram.com/wecanstillhavenicethings/' target='_blank'>Instagram account</a> as well as added a couple of infos on the main <a class='email-link' href='https://wecanstillhavenicethings.com/' target='_blank'>Landing page</a> (let me know what you think!).<br><br>Back to this newsletter now, this edition is full of little ‚ÄúDutch‚Äù references (not intentionally, I promise). Windmills, Dutch justice court,  Dutch repair cafes, I leave you in good company this week."

No matter if you like Maths or not, this video is visually and narratively outstanding.<br>Furthermore, what made me select this video as the <span style='font-style:italic'>highlight of the week</span> is the social takeaways: in Maths (as well as in other disciplines) it is extremely hard to accurately evaluate the level of difficulty of a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù problem."
